<h2>cut back on refined carbs</h2>
<p>One way to lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. This could be with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains.<br>
    When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally end up eating fewer calories .<br>
    With a low carb eating plan, you’ll utilize burning stored fat for energy instead of carbs.<br>
    If you choose to eat more complex carbs like whole grains along with a calorie deficit, you’ll benefit from higher fiber and digest them more slowly. This makes them more filling to keep you satisfied.<br>
    A 2020 study confirmed that a very low carbohydrate diet was beneficial for losing weight in older populations .<br>
    Research also suggests that a low carb diet can reduce appetite, which may lead to eating fewer calories without thinking about it or feeling hungry .<br>
    Note that the long-term effects of a low carb diet are still being researched. It can also be difficult to adhere to a low carb diet, which may lead to yo-yo dieting and less success in maintaining a healthy weight.<br>
    There are potential downsides to a low carb diet that may lead you to a different method. Reduced calorie diets can also lead to weight loss and be easier to maintain for longer periods of time.<br>
    If you opt for a diet focusing instead on whole grains over refined carbs, a 2019 study correlated high whole grain with lower body mass index (BMI) .<br>
    To determine the best way for you to lose weight, consult your doctor for recommendations.<br>
<h2>Eat protein, fat, and vegetables</h2>
<p>

<h2>Protein</h2>
<p>Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight .<br>
    <br>
    Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight, .<br>
    <br>
    Here’s how to determine how much you need to eat without eating too much. Many factors determine your specific needs, but generally, an average person needs :<br>
    <br>
    56–91 grams per day for the average male<br>
    46–75 grams per day for the average female<br>
    Diets with adequate protein can also help:<br>
    <br>
    reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%<br>
    reduce the desire to snack late at night by half<br>
    make you feel full<br>
    In one study, people on a higher protein diet ate 441 fewer calories per day .<br></p>

    <h3>Healthy protein sources include:</h3>
    <p><b>meat</b>: beef, chicken, pork, and lamb<br>
        <b>fish and seafood</b>: salmon, trout, and shrimp<br>
        <b> eggs</b>: whole eggs with the yolk<br>
        <b> plant-based proteins</b>: beans, legumes, quinoa, tempeh, and tofu<br></p>
<h2>Low carb and leafy green vegetables</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They’re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.<br>
</p><br>
<img src="3.jpg"><br>
<h3>Vegetables to include for low carb or low calorie eating plans:
</h3>
<p>broccoli<br>
    cauliflower<br>
    spinach<br>
    tomatoes<br>
    kale<br>
    Brussels sprouts<br>
    cabbage<br>
    Swiss chard<br>
    lettuce<br>
    cucumber<br></p>
    <h2>Healthy fats</h2>
    <p>Don’t be afraid of eating fats.<br>
        <br>
        Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan.<br>
        <br>
        Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content.<br></p>

        <h1>Move your body</h1>
        <p>Exercise, while not required to lose weight, can help you lose weight more quickly. Lifting weights has particularly good benefits.<br>
<br>
            By lifting weights, you’ll burn lots of calories and prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight.<br>
            <br>
            Try going to the gym three to four times a week to lift weights. If you’re new to the gym, ask a trainer for some advice. Make sure your doctor is also aware of any new exercise plans.<br>
            <br>
            If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming is very beneficial for weight loss and general health.<br>
            <br>
            Both cardio and weightlifting can help with weight loss.<br></p>
